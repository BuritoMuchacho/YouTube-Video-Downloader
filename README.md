# YouTube Video Downloader
Hi everyone! This application with simple UI lets you download any video from YouTube to your computer. It's written on Python using *pytube* and *PyQt5* libraries. 

## Getting started 
* To use program, open directory you want it to be saved to in cmd/terminal (you can do that right clicking on directory and choosing *open in terminal* or running `cd path/to/directory`) and download `YouTube-Video-Downloader` running `git clone https://github.com/BuritoMuchacho/YouTube-Video-Downloader`. After that run `cd Youtube-Video-Downloader` or right click on `YouTube-Video-Downloader` directory and choose *open in terminal*. This step is very important as it makes sure files are saved to `YouTube-Video-Downloader` directory. You can rename it if you want.

### If you have Python installed *(recommended)*:
* Run:  
`pip install --upgrade pip`  
`pip install -r requierements.txt`   
`python3 downloader.py`  
**Open `YouTube-Video-Downloader` directory in cmd/terminal everytime you use it.**

### If you don't have Python:
* Run `downloader.exe` in cmd/terminal.
 Run **only** in cmd/terminal and make sure **you opened `YouTube-Video-Downloader` in cmd/terminal everytime you use it.**  
 Note that **64-bit Windows won't run this program as .exe file**. In that case you would need to use Python version.  
 On Linux you might need to use [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/).

**All the videos are saved to `YouTube-Video-Downloader` directory.**
