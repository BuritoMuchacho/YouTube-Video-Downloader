# YouTube Video Downloader
Hi everyone! This application with simple UI lets you download any video from YouTube to your computer. It's written on Python using *pytube* and *PyQt5* libraries. 

## Getting started 
* To run program, download `YouTube-Video-Downloader` directory and **open it in cmd or terminal**. You can do that right clicking on directory and choosing *open in terminal* or by running `cd Path/to/Youtube-Video-Downloader`. This step is very important as it makes sure files are saved to `YouTube-Video-Downloader` directory. You can rename it if you want.

### If you have Python installed:
* Run 
`pip install --upgrade pip` 
`pip install -r requierements.txt`
Then, just run `python3 downloader.py`.
 If you want your files to be saved to `YouTube-Video-Downloader` directory, don't forget to **open this directory in cmd/terminal everytime you use it.**

### If you don't have Python:
* Run `downloader.exe` in cmd/terminal.
 Run **only** in cmd/terminal and make sure **you opened the directory in cmd/terminal.**

**All the videos will be saved to `YouTube-Video-Downloader` directory.**
